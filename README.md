The [chaos-bugbounty-list.json](chaos-bugbounty-list.json) file serves as the central management system for the public bug bounty programs displayed on [chaos.projectdiscovery.io](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/). We welcome your contributions to this list. If there are specific programs for which you'd like to see reconnaissance data, please submit a pull request.

We are currently accepting submissions in JSON format. Here's an example of the structure we require:

```json
{
   "name":"HackerOne",
   "url":"https://hackerone.com/security",
   "bounty": true,
   "swag": true,
   "domains":[
      "hackerone.com",
      "hackerone.net",
      "hacker101.com",
      "hackerone-ext-content.com"
   ],
   "network": [
  "66.232.20.1",
  "66.232.20.0/23",
  "2001:db8::/32"
   ]

}
```

Your contributions will help us to continually improve and expand the range of public bug bounty programs we feature.

- The **domains** field should include TLD names associated with the target program, not necessarily based on the scope of the program.
- Subdomains are populated using our dataset **Passive API**
